# Simple interpreters

This repository contains several simple interpreter implementations:
- [Python](src/python/README.md)
- [Java](src/java/README.md)
- [C](src/c/README.md)

These interpreters feature a REPL shell allowing for interactive evaluation, and support the following operations:
- operators `+, -, *, /, %`.
- variable assignments, e.g. `x = 1` or `x = 1 + 1`
- variable value retrieval, e.g. `x`
- arbitrarily deeply nested operations, e.g. `((1+1-3)*5)/2`

For compilation and running commands, see the individual READMEs listed above.
